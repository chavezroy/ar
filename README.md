# AR Self-Test Webpage

## Run locally

1. From this folder, start a simple server:
   - `python3 -m http.server 8080`
2. Open:
   - `http://localhost:8080/index.html`
3. Allow camera access.
4. Point your camera at a Hiro marker.

If tracking works, you'll see a 3D box and `AR OK` on the marker, and the status panel will show success.
